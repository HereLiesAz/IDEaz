# Agent Instructions

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR ALL AI AGENTS:**

Before committing ANY changes, you **MUST** strictly adhere to the following workflow. **NO EXCEPTIONS.**

1.  **Code Review:** You must request and receive a complete code review.
2.  **Verify Build & Tests:** You must run a full build and ensure all tests pass. Use `./gradlew build` and `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest`.
3.  **Update Documentation:** You must update ALL relevant documentation to reflect your changes. This includes `TODO.md`, `file_descriptions.md`, and any other specific docs.
4.  **Commit:** Only AFTER steps 1-3 are successfully completed may you commit your changes.
