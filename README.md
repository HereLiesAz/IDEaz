This isn't no-code. This is not vibe coding. And this sure as hell ain't straight-up coding.      
This is what every emulator, visual preview, drag and drop WYSIWYG environment was leading up to.

### Development that feels like it's just you and your IDEaz -- The Post-Code IDE for Android.

**Philosophy:**
IDEaz adopts a "Post-Code" philosophy. While powerful developer tools (File Explorer, Code Editor) are available as escape hatches for power users, the primary workflow is visual: Interact with your running app, select what you want to change, and prompt the AI to make it happen. The IDE handles the code generation, git operations, and build process in the background.
