# Cortex IDE: Authentication

## Overview
This document outlines the authentication strategy for the Cortex IDE. The primary goal is to securely authenticate users to both the Android client and the backend AI service, ensuring that user data and project code are protected.

## Authentication Flow
Cortex IDE will use a token-based authentication system, likely based on the OAuth 2.0 protocol and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). This is a standard, secure, and stateless approach for authenticating users in a client-server architecture.

The high-level flow is as follows:
1. The user initiates the login process on the Android client, likely through a third-party identity provider like Google Sign-In.
2. The client handles the sign-in flow with the provider and receives an authentication token (e.g., an ID token from Google).
3. The client sends this provider token to the Cortex AI backend service.
4. The backend service validates the provider token and, if valid, generates its own JWT for the user. This JWT will contain user information and an expiration date.
5. The backend returns this JWT to the Android client.
6. The client securely stores the JWT (e.g., in Android's EncryptedSharedPreferences).
7. For all subsequent requests to the backend API, the client includes the JWT in the `Authorization` header.
8. The backend API validates the JWT on every incoming request to authenticate the user and authorize the action.

## Client-Side Implementation
- The Android client will be responsible for managing the user's authentication state.
- It will use the official Google Sign-In library to provide a seamless and secure login experience.
- User tokens (JWTs) received from the backend will be stored securely on the device using Android's EncryptedSharedPreferences to prevent unauthorized access.
- The networking layer (Ktor/OkHttp) will be configured to automatically attach the JWT to all outgoing requests to the backend.

## Backend Implementation
- The FastAPI backend will have a dedicated endpoint (e.g., `/v1/auth/login`) to handle the initial token exchange.
- It will use a library to validate the incoming token from the identity provider (Google).
- Upon successful validation, it will generate and sign a JWT using a secret key.
- All protected API endpoints will require a valid JWT in the `Authorization` header. Middleware will be used to inspect and validate the token on every request before processing it.

## Security Considerations
- **HTTPS:** All communication between the client and backend will be over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
- **Token Expiration:** JWTs will have a reasonably short expiration time (e.g., 1 hour) to limit the window of opportunity for replay attacks. The client will use a refresh token to obtain a new JWT without requiring the user to log in again.
- **Secure Storage:** Sensitive data like tokens will never be stored in plaintext. Android's EncryptedSharedPreferences is the minimum requirement.
- **Secret Management:** The secret key used to sign JWTs on the backend will be stored securely (e.g., in a cloud secret manager) and never hardcoded into the application.
