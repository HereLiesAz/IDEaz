*   **Safety:** Do not delete user data without explicit instruction and confirmation.
*   **Privacy:** Do not expose API keys or personal tokens in logs or commit messages.
*   **Respect for Directives:** Follow the `AGENTS.md` and `docs/AGENT_GUIDE.md` implicitly.
*   **Non-Destructive:** Do not modify files outside the scope of your task unless absolutely necessary for the build.
*   **Transparency:** Clearly explain what you are doing and why.
