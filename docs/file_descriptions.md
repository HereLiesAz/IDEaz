# Cortex IDE: Documentation File Descriptions

This document provides a brief overview of the purpose of each documentation file in the `docs` folder for the Cortex IDE project.

-   **`UI_UX.md`**: Outlines the user interface and user experience design principles for the Cortex IDE Android application. It covers the core UI components, the visual-first approach, and the use of the Material 3 design system.

-   **`auth.md`**: Describes the authentication strategy for the application. It details the token-based authentication flow (OAuth 2.0/JWT), the roles of the client and backend, and critical security considerations.

-   **`conduct.md`**: Establishes the Code of Conduct for all contributors to the project. It is based on the Contributor Covenant and aims to foster an open, welcoming, and inclusive community.

-   **`data_layer.md`**: Details the local data persistence strategy for the Android client. It explains the use of the Room persistence library for structured data and the potential use of direct SQLite for more complex, performance-critical tasks.

-   **`fauxpas.md`**: A proactive guide that lists common development pitfalls ("faux pas") and the best practices to avoid them. It covers topics like threading, state management, API communication, and security.

-   **`file_descriptions.md`**: This file. It serves as a meta-document to help navigate the project's documentation.

-   **`misc.md`**: A catch-all document for any miscellaneous notes, ideas, or information that does not fit neatly into any of the other more specific documentation files.

-   **`performance.md`**: Focuses on performance considerations for both the Android client and the backend service. It discusses strategies for optimizing UI rendering, minimizing network latency, and ensuring efficient AI model inference.

-   **`screens.md`**: Provides a high-level overview of the different screens and major UI surfaces within the Cortex IDE application, such as the main editor screen, the agent log, and the settings screen.

-   **`task_flow.md`**: Describes the end-to-end user workflow for a typical development task within Cortex IDE. It illustrates how a user interacts with the visual previewer, the AI agent, and the core IDE features to accomplish a goal.

-   **`testing.md`**: Outlines the testing strategy for the project. It covers the different levels of testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end (E2E) UI tests for the Android client, as well as API testing for the backend.

-   **`workflow.md`**: Defines the recommended development workflow for contributors. It covers topics like branch management (e.g., GitFlow), code review processes, and the continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
