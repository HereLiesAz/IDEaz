# IDEaz: Performance Considerations

Performance for IDEaz is measured by the perceived speed and reliability of the AI-driven development loop and the responsiveness of the UI inspection service.

## 1. On-Device "No-Gradle" Build Pipeline Performance
This is the most critical performance area. The user experience is directly tied to the speed of the on-device build.

-   **Compilation Speed:** The "No-Gradle" approach, which directly invokes command-line tools like `aapt2` and `kotlinc`, is designed to be significantly faster and less resource-intensive than a full Gradle build. Performance will depend on the efficiency of this scripted pipeline.
-   **Incremental Builds:** The speed of iterative changes hinges entirely on the incremental build system. The file hash comparison must be rapid, and the logic for selectively skipping build steps must be robust to ensure near-instant rebuilds for minor code changes.
-   **Dependency Resolution:** The on-device Maven resolver is a potential bottleneck. Performance will be managed by aggressive caching of downloaded artifacts to minimize network requests.

## 2. UI Inspection Service Performance
The visual overlay provided by the `AccessibilityService` must feel instant and responsive.

-   **Low Latency:** The time from the user tapping the screen to the UI element's properties being identified and sent to the Host App must be minimal. The service must efficiently traverse the accessibility node tree to avoid any noticeable lag.
-   **Memory Footprint:** As a persistent, privileged service, the UI Inspection Service must have a minimal memory footprint to avoid being terminated by the Android OS.

## 3. Multi-Process Architecture and IPC
The stability of the IDE depends on the reliability and performance of its multi-process architecture.

-   **AIDL Performance:** Communication between the Host App, the Build Service, and the Inspection Service relies on AIDL. While Binder IPC is highly optimized, the data passed between processes should be kept as concise as possible to avoid serialization overhead.
-   **Service Reliability:** The On-Device Build Service and the UI Inspection Service must be robust. As they run in separate processes, their resource consumption must be carefully managed to prevent the OS from terminating them, which would disrupt the entire development workflow. The use of separate processes provides stability, ensuring a crash in one component does not affect the others.
